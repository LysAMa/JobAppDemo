# JobAppDemo
Here's the challenge we set potential dev hires here at Sempo:
------------
What we really value in developers is the ability to just get stuff done, so we've got a challenge for you: give yourself two-ish hours to build something fun. It can be absolutely anything you want, with a few requirements:
- You need to build something from scratch
- It needs be accessible on a web browser
- It has to have some sort of logic executed on the backend (server or serverless)
- *Bonus points:* It uses a hash function somewhere

When you're done, please provide us with a URL that we can use to access what you've built, as well as a link to the github repo. To give you an idea of what we're talking about, here's a demo of something we threw together: 

Demo: http://enjeyw.pythonanywhere.com/
Git hub repo: https://github.com/enjeyw/JobAppDemo

Have fun!
